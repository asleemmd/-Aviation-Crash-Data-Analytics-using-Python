**Airplane Crash Data Analysis:**

This project explores historical airplane crash records to uncover insights about aviation safety, crash frequencies, fatalities, and survival trends. Using Python data analysis and visualization, the dataset is cleaned and analyzed to identify patterns across time, location, and airlines.

**Project Highlights:**

Data Cleaning:

  - Replaced missing values and dropped irrelevant columns.

  - Removed bracketed text (e.g., passenger/crew breakdowns) from Fatalities and Aboard.

  - Converted numerical columns into consistent formats.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

  - Yearly crash and fatality trends.
  
  - Top airlines with most crashes and fatalities.
  
  - Survival rate analysis per airline and per crash.
  
  - Fatality distribution visualizations.

Visualization:

  - Line plots for crash trends over decades.
  
  - Bar charts for airline-level crash and fatality comparisons.
  
  - Heatmaps for survival vs. fatality rates.

**Tech Stack:**

Python,
Pandas, NumPy → data cleaning & preprocessing,
Matplotlib, Seaborn → visualizations

**Applications:**

Understanding aviation safety history and key factors in survivability.
Useful for aviation researchers, safety analysts, and data science enthusiasts interested in accident trend analysis.
